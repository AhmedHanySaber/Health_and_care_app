# Heart Rate Tracker Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Heart Rate Tracker system that utilizes Flutter, Firebase, Arduino, and the ESP8266 module. The primary goal is to monitor and track users' heart rates in real-time, providing valuable insights and guidance through a mobile application. The project also integrates ChatGPT API to facilitate communication between the application and users.

## Components

### 1. Flutter App

The Flutter app serves as the user interface for this system. It receives real-time heart rate data from Firebase and displays it in a user-friendly manner. The app also incorporates a chatbot powered by ChatGPT API to engage with users, providing instructions and information based on their heart rate readings.

### 2. Firebase

Firebase is used as the backend infrastructure for this project. It stores and manages real-time heart rate data received from the Arduino/ESP8266 module. The Flutter app retrieves this data from Firebase to ensure seamless synchronization.

### 3. Arduino and ESP8266

The Arduino board, coupled with the ESP8266 module, forms the hardware component of the project. A pulse sensor is connected to the Arduino to capture real-time heart rate readings. The ESP8266 module facilitates the transmission of this data to Firebase, enabling remote monitoring.

### 4. ChatGPT API

The ChatGPT API is integrated into the Flutter app to enable dynamic and interactive communication with users. The chatbot interacts with users based on their heart rate readings, providing relevant instructions, tips, and information. This adds a personalized touch to the overall user experience.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Heart Rate Tracker project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the Flutter development environment on your computer.
3. Configure Firebase credentials and replace the placeholder values in the Flutter app.
4. Connect the Arduino board to the ESP8266 module and the pulse sensor.
5. Flash the Arduino code to capture and transmit heart rate data.
6. Run the Flutter app on your mobile device or emulator.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, users can:

- Open the Flutter app to view real-time heart rate data.
- Engage with the chatbot to receive personalized instructions and information.
- Monitor their heart rate trends over time through the Firebase backend.
